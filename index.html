  <a>Currently I am studying at the University of Northampton, where I am taking
  upon the course which is Computing Bsc. Within this course specialises in many different
prgramming languages ranging from web languages to languages which are used to program
software or games such as Java. I have recently completed my first year of the course and managed to pass
meaning that I will be continuing my studies at the University of Northampton hopefully for the next two years
at least. Other than studying I need to gain some income from somewhere else while being at University and so
I have a part time job with a company called deliveroo, usually this takes around 4 hours of my daily life from
the hours 5.30-9.30 meaning that I will be able to supply the funds for general living. </a>
